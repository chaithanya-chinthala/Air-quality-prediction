# Air Quality Prediction

This project predicts air quality levels in cities based on real-time data. It uses machine learning models to forecast air quality and classify it into categories like **Good**, **Moderate**, or **Unhealthy**.

## Features
- Predict future air quality index (AQI).
- Classify air quality into different categories.
- Provide suggestions based on the AQI level.

## Technologies
- **Flask**: Web framework for the app.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training models.
- **requests**: Fetch live air quality data.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **joblib**: Save and load trained models.
